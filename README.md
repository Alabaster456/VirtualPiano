VirtualPiano
============


UNCOMPLETE
--
I need more **additions** added to this Virtual Piano, as well as a *better design* overall. The list of things that could be added are endless, but let me just list a few so that you can see for yourself:

1. Better Piano musical notes
2. The ability to be able to use the number keys (ex: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc)
3. A way for the piano to teach you how to play different songs


If it's possible to master these few, the Virtual Piano will be *almost* complete! It's hard creating something you don't do as a hobby (playing the piano), so please give me some advice if anything. :)

Thank you!
